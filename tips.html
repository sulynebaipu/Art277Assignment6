            <p>
                As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully vaccinated might be
                feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn’t the time to let your guard
                down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that you could become infected. <br> <br>
                
                Dr. Cardona explains. <br> <br>
                <q>
                    Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best
protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100%
protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of being
exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.
                </q> 
            </p>   
        </div>
        <h1> Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others,
            including other vacccinated people?
        </h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit 
                COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds that this could 
                also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune response to vaccines. 
                <br> <br>
                “The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may
                not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data
                and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations.”
